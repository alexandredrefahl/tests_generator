# TESTS GENERATOR

This utility was developed to generate **simulated tests for ENADE**, (National Student Performance Exam), based on a Questions Database.

This database of questions can be fed by questions **from previous exams** or by questions **created by the teachers** themselves.

The questions **can be classified by knowledge area**, and **difficulty level**.

When composing the test user can set how many questions of whitch area and the difficulty level.

The output of this program is a **DOCX** (MS Word File) file with **formated questions** including images from original tests, in which the last page contains the **test answer key**.

* **Database:** MS Access MDB
* **Output:** .docx - MS Word File
